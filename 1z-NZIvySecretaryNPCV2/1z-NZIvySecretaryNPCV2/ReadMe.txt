*** Welcome ***

Well Its Been Awhile , Im Null-Z , I Started Modding for 7 Days to die Around the Same time as Thee_Legion , The Author of ENDZ-Chronicles.
In Case if we have some "Fresh Meat" New To Modding.

I Go by the name of NullZ1 in nexus now , feel free to browse on my prior mods if your going to earlier versions of 7 Days to die.

i went to every direction of modding in 7 Days except for Vehicles , im really poor in that category , but my calling that made me push to make even more mods was the inspiration of the NPC Mods and the VRoid Mod

Im very greatful for the Guppy's Discord Community to Help Shape Who i am now during my good and bad times.

i know some have come and gone , and i do my best to make the mods i want to make people excited to play it their way

that was always my motto 

"Play the Game YOUR Way"

recently my burning passion is only NPCs/Zombies/Hostiles/Avatars

Well this Is from me to everyone , Thank you for bringing me into the boat , and your welcome for the Creativity and Inspirations.

well here is a new motto i go with now

"The Game Is Always YOURS To Play"

This Is Null-Z Here Signing out PEACE!!
